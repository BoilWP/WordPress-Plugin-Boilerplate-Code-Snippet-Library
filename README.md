WordPress Plugin Boilerplate Code Snippet Library
========================

This is a community maintained repository of code snippets that will help with the development of your plugin using my [WordPress Plugin Boilerplate](https://github.com/seb86/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate).

Snippets are organized into categories (folders) and each snippet is placed in its own file with a name that describes what it does and where to put the code snippet.

## Using Snippets

1. Click on the filename of the snippet you'd like to use. Each file contains the snippet of code.
2. Click the "Raw" button (next to "Blame" and "History") at the top right.
3. At the top of the file you will find instructions on where to implement the code into the WordPress Plugin Boilerplate.
